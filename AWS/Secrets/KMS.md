# AWS Key Management Service (KMS)

#### Keypoints
- KMS (Key Management Service) in AWS is a region-scoped service that allows users to create and manage the master keys required for encrypting individual data keys. It provides a centralized solution for managing encryption keys and offers additional features, such as support for multi-region customer master keys (CMKs) to facilitate data replication across regions. However, KMS itself does not perform the encryption of data; it focuses solely on the creation and management of master keys used in the encryption process.
