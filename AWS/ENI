The ENI ( default one ) that is associated with the EC2 instance on the startup is slightly different in functionality versus 
the ENI that is created externally and added to the running EC2 instance.

ENI's bound to Availability zone, that means an ENI created in one AZ cannot be moved to another AZ.

Information stored on ENI
- MAC address : The virtual hardware address of the network interface
- Internal IP address: These are allocated by the VPC's DHCP server. AWS documentation says these IP's are static and are taken
  from the IP range of the subnet in which this ENI & Instance are in.
- External IP ( Dyanmic & Elastic ):
- SRC/DEST check flag:
- Security Groups

Security Groups are attached to ENI's not to the EC2 instances.

The ENI created by default with the instance is allocated with a primary IP which cannot be changed, but you can add the
secondary addresses as well. These secondary addresses are auto-allocated or can be explictly specified.

  
**Note: The number of IP's on the ENI's are limited by the machine type not by the ENI.
