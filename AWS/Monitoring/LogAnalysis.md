# Log Analysis

#### Keypoints
- CloudWatch Logs Insights and metric filters are two different features in AWS CloudWatch for log analysis. CloudWatch Logs Insights acts as a query engine that allows users to form SQL queries to search and analyze log data across log groups. It provides the ability to filter and extract specific information based on patterns and conditions. On the other hand, metric filters are pattern-based filters used to extract metrics from log data. They allow matching entire log entries, specific terms, or performing JSON object traversal for filtering purposes. While CloudWatch Logs Insights leverages SQL queries, metric filters focus on pattern matching and extraction.
