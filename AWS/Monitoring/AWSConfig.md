# AWS Config

#### Keypoints
- The purpose of AWS Config in AWS is to provide a detailed inventory of your AWS resources and a history of configuration changes to those resources. AWS Config continuously monitors and records configuration changes, allowing you to assess the compliance and security of your resources, troubleshoot configuration issues, and maintain an audit trail of resource changes over time.
- AWS Config Rules are a key feature of the AWS Config service. They allow you to define custom or pre-configured rules that evaluate the compliance of your AWS resources against desired configurations. These rules help you enforce best practices, security standards, and compliance requirements for your AWS environment.
