# AWS EventBridge

#### Keypoints
- EventBridge is a region-scoped, managed event bus service that grants you the ability to evaluate those events and send those events to specific targets. It also gives you the ability to replay events. So the event bus, rather than being entirely transient, gives you the ability to persist those events for a short period of time
- This allows you to capture events from various sources shown in below diagram and trigger workflows, notifications, or other actions based on those events.
