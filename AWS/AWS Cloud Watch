======================

[syslog]

datetime_format = %b %d %H:%M:%S - !! MUST BE CHANGED TO MATCH YOUR LOG FILE DATE FORMAT !!

file = /var/log/messages - This is where you define the location of the logs that you want to capture

buffer_duration = 5000 - This is the time duration for batching of log events in ms.

log_stream_name = {instance_id}-<sourcetype> - If you leave this as {instance_id} it will be dynamically populated. Replace <sourcetype> with the application log type.

initial_position = start_of_file - This gives you a choice between starting at the start_of_file or end_of_file.

log_group_name = <<ANYNAME>>
