Kinesis Data Streams is the feature of Amazon Kinesis that is designed for streaming data collection.
It allows you to collect data from various disparate sources and store it in a data stream.
It acts as a persistence tier, allowing you to store the contents of a data stream for up to 365 days.
The data in Kinesis Data Streams is replicated across three Availability Zones (AZs), providing durability
similar to other services like Amazon S3.
