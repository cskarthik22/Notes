# AWS Kinesis Firehose

```
Kinesis Data Firehose is the feature of Amazon Kinesis that is designed for many-to-one workloads.
It provides the capability to collect data from multiple producers and deliver it to a single
destination. Data Firehose offers additional features compared to Data Streams, including data
manipulation and transformation, buffer and batch configuration, automatic compression, and
support for various destination options. It allows you to convert data formats, filter or remove
specific elements, and utilize Lambda functions for data transformation. With Data Firehose, you
can deliver data to destinations such as S3, Redshift, AWS OpenSearch, third-party monitoring services,
or arbitrary endpoints using HTTP or HTTPS.
