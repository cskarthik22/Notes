# Datapipeline

#### Keypoints
- The AWS Data Pipeline service is designed for the movement and transformation of data. It allows users to create pipelines that define the flow of data from sources to destinations, including data transformation steps. Unlike real-time data streaming services like Kinesis Data Streams and Kinesis Delivery Streams, Data Pipeline offers the flexibility to perform both data movement and transformation simultaneously.
- It leverages EC2 instances for data transfer and enables the execution of arbitrary AWS CLI commands if additional work is required. Data Pipeline supports cross-region activities and can handle data movement between different AWS accounts.
