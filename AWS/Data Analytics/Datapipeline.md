# Datapipeline

#### Keypoints
- The AWS Data Pipeline service is designed for the movement and transformation of data. It allows users to create pipelines that define the flow of data from sources to destinations, including data transformation steps. Unlike real-time data streaming services like Kinesis Data Streams and Kinesis Delivery Streams, Data Pipeline offers the flexibility to perform both data movement and transformation simultaneously.
