# Amazon Athena

```
This service allows customers to store their structured or semi-structured data 
durably and cost effectively in an S3 bucket and create tables from this data. 
The data can then be queried using SQL through various client side options

```

#### Keypoints
- It utilizes the data sitting in S3, but can be queried using SQL as if you are working with relational database
- Athena Table: It holds metadata and specifies data location & structure. It doesn't hold actual data, instead everything is stored in S3
- Athena Data Catalog: Used for managing metadata
