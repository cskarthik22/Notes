# AWS GuardDuty

#### Keypoints
- GuardDuty utilizes machine learning models to analyze normal activities within your AWS account. By observing regular patterns of behavior, the service builds a model that becomes more refined over time. Based on this model, GuardDuty can detect activities that deviate from the norm and generate findings for further investigation. GuardDuty is designed as a managed threat detection service, focusing on detective controls rather than preventative measures. It cannot stop activities from taking place but can report on them.
