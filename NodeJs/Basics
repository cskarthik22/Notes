Facebook released its own package manager Yarn which is much faster then npm.

you can get the github repos using npm

npm i expressjs/express  (gets the latest release code with last commit)
npm i expressjs/express#4.14.0  ( gets specific version )
npm ls express
npm i express --dry-run ( this dry-run command wont install, instead it will list 
what will be installed)
