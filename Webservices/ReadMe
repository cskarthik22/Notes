Webservice is an application or API on the internet which someone has written to others 
in the world to use, they allow us to hook into it generally via HTTP/HTTPS

Like HTTP, TCP,.. SOAP is just a protcol which is XML based, that allows us to convey procedures/method requests
across the wire with/without arguments and get back return values. 
The underlying transport mechanism standarizes how you are sending int/float/strings/datastructures across the wire
and get some response back.

Beauty of webservices is Tools & libraries will automatically generate SOAP structure code ( STUBS in local box 
& SKELETON in remote box) and does serialization.

SOAP envelope is just a wrapper that holds requests & repsonses of what goes across the wire.
