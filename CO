The set of people who design the computer are called Computer Architects / Computer Designers.
The people who use this computer to do some tasks are called Computer Programers
Various types of computers
- General Purpose Computers: Laptop,desktops...etc uses stored memory concept.
- Computers specific to some task: Washing Machine, calculators...etc. these are are called Embedded systems.

** The core of computers (laptops/washing machine...) is Microprocessors.

General Purpose computers consists of:
- Memory
- Registers
- ALU ( Arthemetic & Logic Unit )

Data has to move from Memory -> Registers -> ALU -> Registers -> Memory, to make all these happen we have to apply certain 
signals at certain timing, so we need a special unit called Control Unit to give signals to all these components at a 
particular time.

The purpose of the designer is to select all these components ( Hardware) based on the cost & connect them.

How to generate signals by looking at the instructions is called Instruction Decoder & that is done by CPU.

Before designing the computers, first Instruction Set ( Machine Instructions ) has to be decided depending on what programmers 
wants to perform. Based on Instruction Set, they choose the Hardware & design the computer.

===============================================================================================================================

INSTRUCTION SET:
- It is a sequence of bits, stored in the special register called IR ( Instruction Register ).
- CPU has to understand how to generate timinig and control signals inorder to execute this Instruction, that is reason it is
  divide in to various parts
  
      -------------------------------------
     | Addressing Mode | Opcode | Operands |
      -------------------------------------
 Addressing Mode: Tells where the operands are located in the memory
 a) Implied Mode: Address is implied in the Opcode, no need to specify address e.g: Increment Accumulator.
 b) Immediate Mode: Used when we use Constants: e.g: pie = 3.14
               LD 5  means AC <-- 5
 c) Register Mode:  
 
      ADD R1 
     
      Register R1 holds the effective address of the operand.
      
   R1 |_____| 
      | 300 |          AC <-- AC + (R1)
      |_____|          AC <-- AC + (300)  
      |.....|          AC <-- AC + 400
      |.....|
  300 | 400 |
      |_____|
    
 d) Register Indirect Mode:
     ADD M[R1]
     
     AC <-- AC + M[R1]
     AC <-- AC + (R1)
     AC <-- AC + (300)
     AC <-- AC + 400
 e) Auto Increment / Auto Decrement: This is register indirect mode.
 f) Direct / Absolute Address Mode: Generally used by variables.
     ADD X
     AC <-- AC + M[X]
     go to memory and access the value present at address X
     Here only one memory access is required inorder get the operand
     
 g) Indirect Address Mode: We can implement pointers using this address mode...
    ADD X
    
    AC <-- AC + M[X]
    AC <-- AC + (400)
    AC <-- AC + 500
    Here 2 memory access is required inorder get the operand 
 h) Relative Address Mode: EA is computer PC + ADDRESS PAR
    Using Program counter it will decide how many words has to go Up or decendant inorder to get next instruction.
    Example: Program loaded in memory with set of instructions.
    
 i) Indexed Address Mode:
 
 j) Base Register Mode:
