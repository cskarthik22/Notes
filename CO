The set of people who design the computer are called Computer Architects / Computer Designers.
The people who use this computer to do some tasks are called Computer Programers
Various types of computers
- General Purpose Computers: Laptop,desktops...etc uses stored memory concept.
- Computers specific to some task: Washing Machine, calculators...etc. these are are called Embedded systems.

** The core of computers (laptops/washing machine...) is Microprocessors.

General Purpose computers consists of:
- Memory
- Registers
- ALU ( Arthemetic & Logic Unit )

Data has to move from Memory -> Registers -> ALU -> Registers -> Memory, to make all these happen we have to apply certain 
signals at certain timing, so we need a special unit called Control Unit to give signals to all these components at a particular
time.

The purpose of the designer is to select all these components ( Hardware) based on the cost & connect them.

How to generate signals by looking at the instructions is called Instruction Decoder & that is done by CPU.

Before designing the computers, first Instruction Set ( Machine Instructions ) has to be decided depending on what programmers 
wants to perform. Based on Instruction Set, they choose the Hardware & design the computer.


INSTRUCTION SET:
- It is a sequence of bits, stored in the sepcial register called IR ( Instruction Register ).
- CPU has to understand how to generate timinig and control signals inorder to execute this Instruction, that is reason it is
  divide in to various parts
