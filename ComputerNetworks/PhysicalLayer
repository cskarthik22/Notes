Network of Computers is called Computer Networks.

Physical Layer completely deals with Hardware.

First LAN setup is done using ETHERNET, they used cables to connect physical computers
* Note: There are 2 kinds of wire
- BASE BAND: Only one station should send signal at the same time across the wire & all other stations should receive it and   there is no multiplexing. If more than one station sends the data there will be collision.
- BROAD BAND: Any station can send the signal at the same time or anytime across the wire without any collisions
Different types of Ethernet Cables used are
a) 10 Base T : This wire capable of speed 10 mbps, BASE - Entire wire at a sametime only one station should send the signal.
T means this wire can run the signal for only 100 meters. If we send a signal over this wire, signal gradually loses its energy and finally it is gets lost.
b) 10 Base 2 : ( 10 mbps is bandwidth, No multiplexing, 200 meters )
c) 10 Base 5 : ( 10 mbps is bandwidth, No multiplexing, 500 meters )
d) 100 Base T :( 100 mbps is bandwidth, No multiplexing, 100 meters )

Computers are connected to eachother using ethernet cables and this is how LAN setup is done.
Since the length of the LAN segment is limited, if we want to extended its size then we have connect more than one LAN segment together using the below devices
a) Repeaters : Takes the signal at one end of the LAN segment and it regenerates the same signal & passes to other LAN segment which is of same type. This device is used very long back.

                   10 BASE 5                         10 BASE 5

b) Hub: It is a multi port repeater.
