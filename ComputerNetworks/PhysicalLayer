Network of Computers is called Computer Networks.

Physical Layer completely deals with Hardware.

First LAN setup is done using ETHERNET, they used cables to connect physical computers
* Note: There are 2 kinds of wire
- BASE BAND: Only one station should send signal at the same time across the wire & all other stations should receive it and   there is no multiplexing. If more than one station sends the data there will be collision.
- BROAD BAND: Any station can send the signal at the same time or anytime across the wire without any collisions
Different types of Ethernet Cables used are
a) 10 Base T : This wire capable of speed 10 mbps, BASE - Entire wire at a sametime only one station should send the signal.
T means this wire can run the signal for only 100 meters. If we send a signal over this wire, signal gradually loses its energy and finally it is gets lost.
b) 10 Base 2 : ( 10 mbps is bandwidth, No multiplexing, 200 meters )
c) 10 Base 5 : ( 10 mbps is bandwidth, No multiplexing, 500 meters )
d) 100 Base T :( 100 mbps is bandwidth, No multiplexing, 100 meters )

Computers are connected to eachother using ethernet cables and this is how LAN setup is done.
The length of the LAN segment is limited, so, if we want to extend its size then we have to connect, more than one LAN segment together using the below devices
a) Repeaters : Takes the signal at one end of the LAN segment and it regenerates the same signal & passes to other LAN segment which is of same type. This device is used very long back.
 - Used at Physical layer only
 - Collisions are possible
 - Range of the LAN is increased

b) Hub: It is a multi port repeater.
   - Used at Physical layer only
   - Traffic is very high
   - Collisions are possible

c) Bridges: It is used to connect 2 different LANS
 Example: one end Ethernet, & other end TokenRing
 - Used at Physical & Data Link layer: Here it can see MAC address of a station & can route the packet accordingly.
   Bridge maintains a forward/mapping table like below.
 - Filtering: since it works at DLL, using MAC address it can filter the stations & send packet to right station.
 - Forwarding:
 - Flooding:
 - No collisions inside a bridge
 - Store & forward a packet
 - To avoid loops spanning tree algorithm is used.

   d) Switch: It is extension to bridge, where it mas more ports to connect stations.
     - Works at physical layer & DataLink Layer, hence it can send packet to the target looking at the MAC address.
     - More than one communcation can happen at the same time ( full duplex wire are connected to stations ).
     - No Collisions
     - Costly, most frequently used in Ethernet LAN.
   e) Router: It is a device which is used to connect two networks
     - Works at Physical Layer, DataLink layer & Network layer
