- Each pod has one or more containers that may expose ports
- Each pod has a routable IP address assigned to it
- Pod Ip address may change during its life time
- Labels are used to logically identify pods that match specific criteria
- Replication Controller's selectors matches the pods based on the labels
- Replication Controllers maintain the desired count all the time
- Replica sets are the next level to Relication Controllers which uses Annotations instead of Labels/Selectors
