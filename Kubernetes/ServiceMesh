- Large application is broken down to multiple micro-services & they all talk to each other in the form of Mesh called as 
  Service Mesh.
- In the above scenario we have couple of challenges. Between the microservices we have
  a) No Enryption by default
  b) No retries, No failover's
  c) No intellegent Loadbalancing, the Ingress controller will just do round-robin
  d) No Routing decisions made btw the applications.. it can be applied only at Ingress controller
  e) No Metrics/logs/traces
  f) No access control
  
 *** Implementing all these for an application is an extra effort, so one solution to this is to add a proxy to each pod 
 which does all these operations, this is called side car deployment.
 ISTIO is the great solution for this.
 
 kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f web-deployment.yml)
